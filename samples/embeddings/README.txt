Semantic Scholar Academic Graph Datasets

The "embeddings" dataset provides embeddings representing a paper's contents in vector form.

The model is based on the SPECTER model available at https://github.com/allenai/specter. However, the embeddings
included in this dataset are not compatible with the embeddings produced by the pretrained model from that repo.
