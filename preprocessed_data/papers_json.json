SQL was initially solely used with relational database management systems (RDBMS), but as additional categories of database systems have emerged, its use has substantially expanded. When processing Big Data, or datasets with great volume, velocity, and variety, highly distributed and scalable systems have been proven to be particularly effective at using SQL as a query language. Although conventional relational databases currently only make up a small portion of the database systems landscape, the majority of database courses that cover SQL only take traditional relational systems into account when using SQL. In this study, we suggest that SQL be taught as a general language, which can be applied to a variety of database systems, ranging from conventional RDBMSs to Big Data systems. In the context of emerging database systems like MapReduce, NoSQL, and NewSQL, this paper offers well-organized suggestions for introducing SQL. The description of a variety of course tools, such as virtual machines, sample projects, and in-class exercises, to provide hands-on experience with SQL across a wide range of contemporary database systems is a fundamental addition of this work.

Big Data is a collection of data that is huge in volume, yet growing exponentially with time. It is a data with so large size and complexity that none of traditional data management tools can store it or process it efficiently. Organizations need to manage and analyze big data for better decision making and outcomes. So, big data analytics is receiving a great deal of attention today. In healthcare, big data analytics has the possibility of advanced patient care and clinical decision support. In this paper, we review the background and the various methods of big data analytics in healthcare.

As to healthcare is concerned, data is becoming more complex and is difficult to process in the long run. How to manage data has been an important issue to resolve. New development was also successful in collecting and storing healthcare data anytime remotely, hence the ubiquitous healthcare systems. Big data analytics has the potential to transform the way healthcare providers use sophisticated technologies to gain insight from their clinical and other data repositories and make informed decisions. In this study, we will discuss the use and application of big data analytics for u-healthcare.

We are living in an era of data deluge and as a result, the term \u201cBig Data\u201d is appearing in many contexts. It ranges from meteorology, genomics, complex physics simulations, biological and environmental research, finance and business to healthcare. Big Data refers to data streams of higher velocity and higher variety. The infrastructure required to support the acquisition of Big Data must deliver low, predictable latency in both capturing data and in executing short, simple queries. To be able to handle very high transaction volumes, often in a distributed environment; and support flexible, dynamic data structures. Data processing is considerably more challenging than simply locating, identifying, understanding, and citing data. For effective large-scale analysis all of this has to happen in a completely automated manner. This requires differences in data structure and semantics to be expressed in forms that are computer understandable, and then \u201crobotically\u201d resolvable. There is a strong body of work in data integration, mapping and transformations. However, considerable additional work is required to achieve automated error-free difference resolution.

The system uses medical terms such as sex, blood pressure, cholesterol like 13 attributes to predict the likelihood of patient getting a Heart disease. Until now, 13 attributes are used for prediction. This research paper added two more attributes i.e. obesity and smoking. The data mining classification techniques, namely Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks are analyzed on Heart disease database. The performance of these techniques is compared, based on accuracy. As per our results accuracy of Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes are 100%, 99.62%, and 90.74% respectively.
